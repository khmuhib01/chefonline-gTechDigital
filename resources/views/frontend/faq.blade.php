                                        Not all backlinks are created equal. A good backlink is one that comes from high-quality websites that are relevant to your industry. Such links are crucial because Google considers them as signals of trust, similar to how good reviews function for a business. They indicate that reputable sources are referencing your website, which boosts your site's authority and credibility.
